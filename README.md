# CP1404 Practicals TR3 2022

## Summary

This repo contains all my practicals for trimester 3 in 2022 for CP1404

## About me

My name is Brodie Kirkland, and I am currently in my final stretch for my bachelors degree in commerce.

## Things I have learned

1. Clean code is easy to read.
2. Clean code should be able to explain itself, but when necessary you can use short comments to clarify.
3. Clean code should be understandable even if it's read years from now.
